### Scope of Global search
To implement the global search functionality across the specific apps in World of Shows (Base, Shows, Venues, Classes, Auditions, Play Reads), you can follow these steps:

1. Design the Search Bar Component: Create a reusable search bar component that can be included on every page of your platform. This component should have an input field where users can enter their search queries and a search button or icon to trigger the search.

2. Implement Search Functions in Each App: In each app, define a search function in the respective view that handles the search functionality specific to that app. For example:

   - In the Shows app, create a `search_shows` function in the show views that searches for shows based on the show titles, descriptions, genres, or other relevant attributes.
   - In the Venues app, create a `search_venues` function in the venue views that searches for venues based on the venue names, locations, capacities, or other relevant attributes.
   - In the Classes app, create a `search_classes` function in the class views that searches for classes based on the class titles, instructors, locations, or other relevant attributes.
   - In the Auditions app, create a `search_auditions` function in the audition views that searches for auditions based on the audition titles, dates, locations, or other relevant attributes.
   - In the Play Reads app, create a `search_playreads` function in the play read views that searches for play reads based on the play read titles, dates, locations, or other relevant attributes.

   Implement the search functions in their respective views, considering the specific data and logic of each app. These functions will handle searching, displaying results, and handling empty results within their respective views.

3. Import Search Functions: In the global search component, import the search functions from the corresponding views where they are defined. You can import the necessary modules or files that contain the search functions for each app.

4. Execute Search Functions: When a user enters a search query and triggers the search, determine the current app or module context. Based on the context, invoke the corresponding search function from the imported views. For example:

   - If the user is on a page related to shows, invoke the `search_shows` function from the show views with the search query.
   - If the user is on a page related to venues, invoke the `search_venues` function from the venue views with the search query.
   - Similarly, invoke the relevant search functions for classes, auditions, and play reads based on the user's context.

   The invoked search function will handle searching, displaying results, and handling empty results within its respective app.
